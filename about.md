Hi! I'm Kira. I'm a Canadian web developer from Fredericton, NB. I'm based in Montreal now and love it here. I'm also passionate about justice and do what I can to spread reason, but my optimism dwindles from time to time. 

Right now I'm learning Ruby and Rails and also trying to understand some fundamentals of CS, writing some small programs in C. This website is [built with jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). I love the tech and especially web development scenes in Montreal which is a huge reason I'm getting more involved.

When I'm not on my computer I knit, do yoga, or just get lost exploring the city. Feel free to [get in touch with me on twitter](https://twitter.com/kiraemclean).
