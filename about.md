Hi! I'm Kira. I'm a Canadian web developer from Fredericton, NB. I'm based in Montreal now and love it here. I'm also passionate about justice and do what I can to spread reason, but my optimism dwindles from time to time. 

Right now I'm learning Ruby and Rails and also trying to understand some fundamentals of CS, writing some small programs in C. This website is [built with jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/){:target='_blank'}. I love the tech and web development scenes in Montreal which is mostly I'm getting more involved.

When I'm not on my computer I knit, do yoga, or just get lost exploring the city. I love travelling and politics. My dream is to work for an awesome tech company here in Montreal. Have fun looking around, or find me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/kiraemclean){:target='_blank'} or [github](https://github.com/kiramclean){:target='_blank'}.
