        <h2><a href="http://kiramclean.com/blog/switching-from-sublime-to-vim/">Switching From Sublime To Vim</a></h2>
        <p>I learned how to code using Sublime as my editor but recently joined a team that uses mostly vim. There are a few reasons I prefer Vim now, but there are still a few things I miss about Sublime. Here I&rsquo;ll tell you what I did to try to bridge the transition and bring the features I missed from Sublime to Vim. Why Switch? First of all, why would you switch editors?<a href="http://kiramclean.com/blog/switching-from-sublime-to-vim/">Read more ...</a></p>

        <h2><a href="http://kiramclean.com/blog/what-your-rails-app-does-behind-the-scenes/">What Your Rails App Does Behind The Scenes</a></h2>
        <p>Ever wondered what your rails app is really doing? When I first started learning rails it seemed like magic. I finally got started building some rails apps and couldn&rsquo;t believe I could get one up and running in 5 minutes. What is this magic? Needless to say there&rsquo;s a lot going on behind the scenes. I was living in blissful ignorance, building away and not worrying about how it all worked until it didn&rsquo;t anymore.<a href="http://kiramclean.com/blog/what-your-rails-app-does-behind-the-scenes/">Read more ...</a></p>

        <p>I&rsquo;m talking about Jerusalem. My last couple of posts reflected on the first few days of my Birthright trip to Israel which were spent in the north of the country. After that we spent a day in Tel Aviv and Jaffa on our way to Jerusalem, where we stayed for three nights. It&rsquo;s a truly magical place. Walking the streets of Jerusalem is when I first realized that I have to go back to Israel.<a href="http://kiramclean.com/blog/maybe-the-worlds-most-meaningful-city/">Read more ...</a></p>

        <p>I just woke up from a 15 hour nap. I got home yesterday after leaving Israel 20 hours earlier and completely crashed. Birthright was a life changing experience in many ways but I feel like it will take a long time to process. The trip itself was jam packed with events, activities, and discussions, and I haven&rsquo;t really had any time to think or reflect since the first day. Now that I&rsquo;m back home and have some down time, it&rsquo;s all starting to sink in.<a href="http://kiramclean.com/blog/beginning-to-process-birthright/">Read more ...</a></p>

        <h2><a href="http://kiramclean.com/blog/first-day-in-israel/">First Day In Israel</a></h2>
        <p>My first full day in Israel is wrapping up. I&rsquo;m here on a Birthright trip, a program sponsored by Israeli taxpayers, Jewish philanthropists, and local Jewish communities around the world. It&rsquo;s meant to give Jewish youth the opportunity to experience Israel with a group of their peers. It&rsquo;s an amazing gift to have been given, and I&rsquo;m looking forward to every moment of it. After landing yesterday we got on a bus to drive north, stopping in Zihron Ya&rsquo;akov for lunch and a quick tour.<a href="http://kiramclean.com/blog/first-day-in-israel/">Read more ...</a></p>

        <h2><a href="http://kiramclean.com/blog/getting-started-with-git/">Getting Started With Git</a></h2>
        <p>Git makes keeping track of your progress and fixing mistakes &ldquo;simple&rdquo;, as they say. I was beyond confused at first but things slowly started to click. If you can wrap your head around what it does and how it works, git can idiot-proof your workflow and set you free to experiment on new features without worrying about ruining your project. Adding and committing files to a git repository is the first thing most people teach, and it was the first thing I learned.<a href="http://kiramclean.com/blog/getting-started-with-git/">Read more ...</a></p>

        <p>Another week flew by and I still don&rsquo;t have my own app up and running. Montreal has an awesome ruby community, though, and this week they hosted a meetup to build their new website with ruby on rails. Thanks to some wonderful, patient people I learned a lot and am much closer to being able to do it on my own. I&rsquo;m not sure how much closer Montreal.rb is to having a new website that works, though.<a href="http://kiramclean.com/blog/benefits-of-group-learning/">Read more ...</a></p>

        <h2><a href="http://kiramclean.com/blog/learning-how-to-code/">Learning How To Code</a></h2>
        <p>At beginning of last summer I started learning how to code. I had a wordpress website and wanted to customize it, then I got sucked into a rabbit hole and haven&rsquo;t really surfaced since. I realized I would only be able to make it so far coding in a box on a website with tutorials, as great as they are, and about 2 months ago I decided to go all in.<a href="http://kiramclean.com/blog/learning-how-to-code/">Read more ...</a></p>
