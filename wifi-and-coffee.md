Computer programming can pretty quickly lead to isolation. I often work in cafes just to get out of the house and force myself to go for a walk to step away from the computer for a bit. I can usually count on JavaU, Second Cup, Starbucks, or Presse Cafe, but there are tons of great boutique cafes in Montreal, too. These are some of the best places I've found with fast, reliable wifi (passwords below!) and good coffee.

**Cafe Carrefour** • 3131 rue Bélanger, Saint-Michel • wifi: cafe3131<br>
**Cafe Aunja** • 1448 rue Sherbrooke O., Downtown • wifi: gingertea

Do you know any others? Let me know below.
