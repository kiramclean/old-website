Hi! I'm Kira. I'm a Canadian web developer from Fredericton, NB. I'm based in Montreal now and love it here. I'm also passionate about justice and do what I can to spread reason.

Right now I'm learning Ruby and Rails and also trying to understand some fundamentals of CS, writing some small programs in C and Go. This website is [built with hugo](https://gohugo.io). I love the tech and web development communities in Montreal which is mostly why I'm getting more involved.

When I'm not on my computer I knit, do yoga, play violin, or just get lost exploring the city. I love travelling and politics. My dream is to work for an awesome tech company from a beach in Spain. Have fun looking around, or find me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/kiraemclean) or [github](https://github.com/kiramclean).
