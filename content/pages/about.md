Hi! I'm Kira. I'm a Canadian web developer from Fredericton, NB. I'm based in Montreal now and love it here. I'm also passionate about justice and do what I can to spread reason.

Right now I'm learning Ruby and Rails and also trying to understand some fundamentals of CS, writing some small programs in C and Go. This website is {{% target_blank "built with hugo" "https://gohugo.io" %}}. I love the tech and web development scenes in Montreal which is mostly I"m getting more involved.

When I'm not on my computer I knit, do yoga, play violin, or just get lost exploring the city. I love travelling and politics. My dream is to work for an awesome tech company from a beach in Spain. Have fun looking around, or find me on {{% target_blank "twitter" "https://twitter.com/kiraemclean" %}} or {{% target_blank "github" "https://github.com/kiramclean" %}}.
