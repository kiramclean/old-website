I love Rails but never really realized how slow it was until I got a taste of some other development tools out there.


I'm a big fan of TDD for a lot of reasons, but testing Rails can be kind of a drag. As much as I love it, it slows me down. Waiting 5 seconds or (10 or 20) for a test to run doesn't cut it when you're working with a tight feedback look, running specs every minute or more.

To use zeus with cucumber takes some additional configuration. This is the setup, from [this helpful example in the zeus repo](https://github.com/burke/zeus/blob/master/examples/custom_plan/cucumber_plan.rb).


To set up zeus for your project, first install it with `gem install zeus`. Note you don't need it in your gemfile, it runs outside of your Rails app.

If you just use rspec, you're good to go. Run `zeus start` in a terminal window and you'll see all the commands
