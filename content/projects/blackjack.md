This was my first ever web app. It's built with sinatra, a lightweight framework for Ruby where you route each incoming request and provide a redirect or view. I built it to learn about HTTP and how web requests and responses work. It was also a great introduction to Rack-compliant web apps and helped to get an understanding of how they work before diving into Ruby's much more complicated framework, Rails.
