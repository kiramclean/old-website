This is a Rails app I built to learn about testing when I joined a team that does almost exclusively test-driven development. We used cucumber so I wanted to use it in a side project to learn more about this testing DSL. This was also the first app I built with some nicer front-end features, like a date-picker and data visualizations. You can log your workouts and see your progress on a graph, and you can also follow friends to see their updates.
