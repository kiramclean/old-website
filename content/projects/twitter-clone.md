This is the first Rails app I built to learn, well, Rails. The authentication system is built from scratch so I could see how Rails works a little bit behind the scenes. Most of the apps I've built since this use devise or some other authentication gem to handle user flow, but building this was a great way to get familiar with how Rails handles authentication, authorization, and sending email.
